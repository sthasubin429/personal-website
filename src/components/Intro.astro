    About Me
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am a data scientist passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights
    that drive real-world impact. My work focuses on statistical analysis and software engineering,
    creating data-driven solutions that uncover meaningful patterns and are built with scalable,
    production-ready code.

    Currently, I am pursuing a Post-Degree Diploma in Data Analytics at Langara College and working
    as a Student Aide at the Applied Research Center. I analyze complex datasets and create
    interactive visualizations to help faculty and researchers make informed decisions. My expertise
    includes Python and R programming, statistical modeling, and building machine learning pipelines
    that solve business problems with data science solutions.

    Previously, I have developed software for enterprise live streaming platforms, large-scale web
    applications, and AI-powered music generation systems. With over three years of software
    engineering experience, I bring a unique perspective to building robust, maintainable data
    science workflows. Additionally, I mentor more than 25 students in data analytics and
    programming, helping them bridge the gap between theory and practical application.
