    I'm a data scientist passionate about transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive real-world impact. My favorite work lies at the
    intersection of statistical analysis and software engineering, creating data-driven solutions that not only uncover meaningful patterns but are built with
    scalable, production-ready code.

    Currently, I'm pursuing a Post-Degree Diploma in Data Analytics at Langara College while working as a Student Aide at the Applied Research Center, where I
    analyze complex datasets and create interactive visualizations that help faculty and researchers make informed decisions. I specialize in Python and R
    programming, statistical modeling, and building machine learning pipelines that translate business problems into data science solutions.

    In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings â€” from enterprise live streaming platforms and large-scale web
    applications to AI-powered music generation systems. My 3+ years of software engineering experience gives me a unique perspective on building robust,
    maintainable data science workflows. Additionally, I also mentor 25+ students in data analytics and programming concepts, helping them bridge the gap
    between theory and practical application.
