        Hello! My name is Subin and I enjoy creating things that solve real-world problems with
        data. My interest in programming started during my Computer Science degree when I discovered
        how code could bring ideas to life, turns out building my first web application taught me a
        lot about the power of technology to connect people!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to today, I've had the privilege of working at a
        <Link href='https://www.outcodesoftware.com/'>fast-paced startup</Link>,
        <Link href='https://bajratechnologies.com/'>established tech companies</Link>, and now in
        academic research. My main focus these days is building data-driven solutions and machine
        learning models at Langara College's
        <Link href='https://students.langara.ca/about-langara/applied-research/index.html'>Applied Research Center</Link>,
        where I analyze complex datasets and create insights that support important research
        initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not analyzing datasets, I enjoy working on personal projects like building
        AI-powered applications and exploring new machine learning techniques that push the
        boundaries of what's possible with data.
